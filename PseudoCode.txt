for all actions&assignments:
    record in the general relations the action/relative assignment that makes it be a precondition or an effect

create a list of all possible action&assignments in the format received by the Quine_McCluskey algorithm

for all specific relations (affirmed or negated):
    produce from the relative assignments, the absolute assignments that make it a precondition or effect
    
    create the action implies precondition, and action implies effect clauses
    
    
    copy the initially created list
    for all the actions that make this specific relation an effect, remove them from said list
    

If a specific relation is not the effect of any possible action, its 2 frame axiom clauses simply state that it does not change
