for all specific relations:
	for all action names:
        For every precondition:
            collect the argument assignment, if any, that makes this precondition equal the specific relation

    each of those argument assignments for every action name will produce a DNF clause.
    Negate them all, and add the specific relation, and we get a CNF "action implies precondition" clause.


for all specific relations:
	for all action names:
        For every effect:
            collect the argument assignment, if any, that makes this effect equal the specific relation
    
    each of those argument assignments for every action name will produce a DNF clause. (After conversion)
    
    For each of those clauses_
        Negate all literals, and add the specific relation (in the next time step), and we get a CNF "action implies effect" clause.
    
    For every possible combination of selections from these DNF clauses, create a CNF clause, and collect it in a set (no repetitions)
    To the resulting sentence, apply simplification procedure similar to SAT_solver
